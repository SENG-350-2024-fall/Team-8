## Project Idea

**Medical Information System To Enhance Resources for Emergency Departments - Mister Ed** 

Emergency Departments (EDs) are often crowded and overloaded. The Mister Ed system will be designed to help with this situation. People who feel that they need to visit an ED will be able to use Mister Ed to understand the current load of EDs in their area. They will be able to register virtually and undergo a "virtual triage" to determine whether they really should visit the ER or potentially follow another course of action, like going to a regular primary care clinic (GP), taking over-the-counter medication, or contact the nurse/clinician hotline over the phone or Internet. Patients who can safely be triaged virtually but still need to visit the ED can wait from the comfort of their home and will be notified to come in when it is time to see them. Patients who need to be triaged in person are asked to attend but can then return to their homes until it is time to see them.
